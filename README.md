## Project Overview

This repository hosts the code and resources for a comprehensive sales data analysis and reporting project that incorporates sales prediction using regression-based machine learning. The project's primary objective is to analyze historical sales data, visualize trends, and make predictions for future sales performance.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: For data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning.
- **SQL**: For data storage and retrieval.
- **JupyterLab**: For data analysis and exploration.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and reporting.

## Project Phases

### Data Collection and Preparation

- **Data Collection**: We sourced a real-world sales order dataset from Kaggle, a reputable platform for data sets. The dataset contained historical sales order information, providing a realistic basis for our analysis.

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: The raw data from Kaggle required initial data cleaning. We performed tasks like handling missing values, addressing duplicates, and ensuring consistent date formatting. This clean data was vital for accurate analysis and predictions.

- **Data Import into MySQL**: We created a MySQL database named `sales_data_analysis` and established a table within it, named `sales`. This SQL database served as a structured repository for our cleaned sales data. We employed MySQL's data import capabilities to efficiently load our data into the database, ensuring its organized storage.


### Data Analysis with Python

- Use JupyterLab to perform data analysis.
- Explore the dataset using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- Calculate key metrics, identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the data.
- Perform statistical analysis to gain insights into the dataset.

### SQL Data Retrieval

- Write SQL queries to extract specific data from the database.
- Retrieve data related to product categories, regions, or customer segments for further analysis.

### Data Visualization with Python

- Create visualizations using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to represent your findings.
- Generate graphs, charts, and plots that highlight sales trends, customer segments, or product performance.

### Sales Prediction with Regression

- Choose a regression model suitable for sales prediction, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or random forest regression.
- Preprocess data for machine learning, including feature engineering and data splitting.
- Train and evaluate the regression model using Python libraries such as scikit-learn.

### JupyterLab Report

- Combine your analysis, sales prediction results, and insights into a Jupyter Notebook.
- Provide explanations, insights, and recommendations based on your analysis and sales predictions.
- Document your data analysis, machine learning process step by step.

### Data Export

- Export the clean and preprocessed data as a CSV file for use in Power BI.

### Data Visualization with Power BI

- Import the cleaned data into Power BI.
- Create interactive and insightful reports, dashboards, and visualizations in Power BI that include sales predictions.
- Set up slicers, filters, and interactive elements for user-driven data exploration.

### Report Deployment and Sharing

- Publish your Power BI reports to the Power BI Service (Power BI Online).
- Share the reports with stakeholders, team members, or clients.
- Schedule data refreshes to ensure that your reports remain up to date.

## Project Benefits

- Advanced data analysis: Understand sales trends and customer behavior with the aid of regression-based sales predictions.
- Predictive capabilities: Forecast future sales and identify factors influencing sales performance.
- Data-driven decision-making: Enable stakeholders to make informed decisions based on insights and sales predictions.
- Interactive reporting: Provide users with the ability to explore data and sales predictions using Power BI.
